With this plugin, attributes you add in their component, e.g. title, meta attributes, etc. will get added to the static HTML pages Gatsby builds.\"")) "Provides drop-in support for server rendering data added with React Helmet."

1. **`sharp`**: ([documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sharp/ "\"... a low-level helper plugin generally used by other Gatsby plugins.
